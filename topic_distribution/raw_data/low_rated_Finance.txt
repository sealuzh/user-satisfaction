192dfcf4-dff3-11e6-8f37-fa163e345ce9,com.bloomberg.android.plus,Further proof Bloomberg is losing touch with users. The terminal is being dumbed down & now apps. App is only designed for phone in portrait mode. Worthless on tablet. News is oriented for people who like to scroll & scroll with pictures. Direct viewing of headlines is gone. Limited push of notifications & notifications do not take you to story but rather to the home page. Gone is night mode. TV is accessible but slow to load & not always obvious or located in same spot. TV in landscape is is worthless as a big pause & share icon take real estate along with a close X. Appear to have corrected graying out of TV in landscape. Previous version allowed for full screen view but this one does not. If I could rate it a zero  I would.

(was my favorite app) Now I can see less videos  and there's no video carousel (new scrolling of large thumbnails is really confusing  and it crashes!)  the black interface was WAY nicer  this made it stand out from other apps as a premium app. Can't see """"""""""""""""next video"""""""""""""""" suggestion while watching current video  channels are not obvious with no more hamburger menu.... Brutal update. CNBC I'm coming back. I would be happy to pay for this app (but only the previous version )  why not just charge us for a good ad-free quality version so we get live TV  high quality content  and a top notch UI) instead of this flashy tabloid version""""",February 02 2017,1,1857

50fc08c8-ec42-11e6-a3aa-fa163e345ce9,com.bloomberg.android.plus,This new version of app sucks. I hate the layout  the light color scheme  the way it's organized. Worst of all they took away the technical indicators on the charts. Now you have to pay for the pro version for that. You might as well pay for a different app with much better charts.,February 05 2017,1,1858
52125ac9-ec42-11e6-a3aa-fa163e345ce9,com.bloomberg.android.plus,Why. The app has iphone icons everywhere. Obviously an iphone port. Bloomberg does not consider android users important. Also while watching a video the android notification window won't work and will force scroll you through Bloomberg aop. Also without a widget I stopped reading bloomberg.

5a8a52ef-ec42-11e6-a3aa-fa163e345ce9,com.bloomberg.android.plus,Better than what I thought I was reluctant to upgrade to new version after reading all bad reviews about this latest update until I was forced to which I was not happy but went ahead to upgrade. To my surprise  it didn't crash as I was afraid  though the new white background is not my preference  some features take time to find but they are there  news layout wasn't not as dense as before  but I can tolerate  watchlist is simply to setup and reliable  so I am OK with this latest update though it was not my choice.

But this new version makes it difficult to navigate around. I just realised I haven't open it for days. Also  I use to be able to point to spot on the graph and it will show me the date and price at the spot. But that feature has been taken out. The comparison feature is awesome but this version only opens two indexes for us to compare. To open up the rest  a pop up message kept asking us to upgrade to Bloomberg Professional.

It's all added together and shown at the bottom of the screen. I really don't need to see my savings figured in with the rest of my balance because I mainly use my checking account. There are no settings to enter a check number or a checkbox to say something has been cleared or reconciled. You have to manually input every expense that you would use from the start instead of doing it as you go.

If you stay and think about it its even worse than gambling or like buying 1$ lotery tickets and hoping for 1.5$ jackpot and WHOA YOU ALMOST DOUBLED YOUR MONEY!!! (but wait  you dont win 1.5$ you actually get back your bet 1$ and win which is 0.5$ so even 1 lose can wipe 2 wins in a row with high return binaries  anything over 50% return is OTC which means broker is drawing prices for fools)  you must be stupid to fall for that and thats why they advertise binary options as simple and no experience required to start trading  anyone with IQ above 50 will see he trick btw binaries are traded on dealing desk only so all your loses go to brokers pocket.,February 12 2017,1,1887
