7be48357-afc9-11e6-934f-c4b301cdf627,com.mendhak.gpslogger,Poor accuracy Went for a walk at lunch today. Turned on my phone's GPS and started this GPS Logger app from inside my office building. Took me about 1 minute to get outside  walked about 20 minutes and then turned it off when I got back inside. It said I walked over 7 miles for a route I know is much less than 2 miles. At least this version is better than the previous one  that only logged points if my phone was on and the app was active. What I think should be changed is that when logging it started it should not start until the GPS gets a lock. I think it's using the previous location  which it should not do. And settings should show in their menu item instead of having to select each item to see what the value is.,March 27 2015,1,1289

92cae01e-dfc1-11e6-8f37-fa163e345ce9,com.google.android.street,Since the day they migrated from Google Photo Community to Street View app there are lot of problems. Which needs to be addressed quickly; 1. App does not connects to LG 360 Cam (though it is listed as compatible device) 2. Photographs taken from LG 360 Cam are getting rejected. 3. There is no option to challenge / request a review for rejected photographs. 4. Rejected photos should show the reason for rejection. 5. No customer support (Zero) I tried reaching them through feedback  support blog & mail. NO RESPONSE at all. 6. Navigation is not appearing on Mobile Devices even after connecting multiple 360 photos (on desktop navigation is appearing) I request developer to make this app user friendly with the features which were available on early Google Photographer Community portal. Currently the app is appearing like it is under the influence of dictatorship .,January 03 2017,2,1875

Whoever took the first photo of this place took a picture of the wrong address on the other side. So since I thought it would be a bit more convenient for myself to actually see where I was going  I lost my fee and probably a large tip because some idiot doesn't know how to follow the instructions. Thanks Google  for crap. I'm blaming Google. I thought Google was supposed to be pretty damn smart since you can ask ANYTHING and get an answer. But not directions. Someone or some department should be following up on photos people take of places AND FIX IT BEFORE it becomes a F****** problem. If Google was really that smart  they'd have already thought of that idea... I always thought Google was kind of a waste anyways. That's my review. Before  Google wasn't even worth the time to write a review about. Not for me. I guess your worth a little something.

The checkin needs to be done between 4 days and 2 hours before the flight  otherwise they charge 45 euros. The purpose of checkin at this point is meaningless to the user and a total scam. They also tell you you need to pay extra if your bag weighs more than 20 kg  but if it is a carry on  it doesn't say  so you end up paying more for nothing.

Therefore this app is useless unless you put your own wifi password in  but that doesn't benefit you. You could hack a bunch and add them  but again  doesn't benefit you. Waste of time to even look at the app's page in the play store. You just wasted 10 seconds or more :P Sorry my rating is my opinion and I am allowed to have one.
